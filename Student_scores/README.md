# Predicting Student Performance Based on Study Hours

Supervised Learning is a method where the model is trained using a dataset that contains known inputs and outputs. The model learns from this data to predict the output of new, unseen data. The main type of supervised learning in this project is regression. Regression is a supervised learning method used to predict continuous values, one example of which is predicting student scores based on the number of study hours. Hours is the input and Scores is the target (output) that we want to predict.

**Data Splitting**
For this project, the data was split into:
75% for training the model, 25% for testing the model.

**Model Comparison**
Two models were compared in this project: Decision Tree and Linear Regression. Based on the results, Linear Regression is recommended as it performed better than the Decision Tree model, because R Score for Linear Regression: 95 higher than R Score for Decision Tree: 88

# Usage

estimate student scores based on their study hours, which can be useful for:
- Identifying the optimal number of study hours for better performance.
- Providing personalized study plans for students.
- Helping educators to better allocate resources and support to students based on their predicted performance.
