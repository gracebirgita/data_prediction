# Predicting Student Performance Based on Study Hours

Supervised Learning is a method where the model is trained using a dataset that contains known inputs and outputs. The model learns from this data to predict the output of new, unseen data. The main type of supervised learning in this project is regression. Regression is a supervised learning method used to predict continuous values, one example of which is predicting student scores based on the number of study hours. Hours is the input and Scores is the target (output) that we want to predict.


# Usage

estimate student scores based on their study hours, which can be useful for:
- Identifying the optimal number of study hours for better performance.
- Providing personalized study plans for students.
- Helping educators to better allocate resources and support to students based on their predicted performance.
