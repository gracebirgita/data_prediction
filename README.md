1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Each dataset undergoes a comprehensive EDA process to understand its structure, relationships, and trends. Key techniques include:
    - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
    - Visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps).
    - Statistical summaries and insights.

2. Linear Regression
    - Applied to datasets for predicting continuous variables.
    - Covers preprocessing, model training, evaluation (e.g., Mean Squared Error, RÂ²), and feature importance.

3. Logistic Regression
    - Focused on binary or multi-class classification problems.
    - Includes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

4. Logistic Regression vs Naive Bayes
    - A comparative analysis of Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes for specific classification datasets.
    - Evaluation based on model performance metrics to identify the best-suited algorithm.

5. Recommender System
    - Implements collaborative filtering(item based, user based) and content-based recommendations.
    - Aimed at personalized suggestions using user-item interaction data.
